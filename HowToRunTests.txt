To run the test for Room:

Place yourself in the directory above se/

This directory should have the database cavedatabas.db and the
driver for the SQLite3 JDBC.

Issue the following to compile and run the Room test:

javac se/itu/game/test/TestRoom.java && java -cp .:sqlite-jdbc-3.16.1.jar -ea se.itu.game.test.TestRoom
Running test R1 - connecting two rooms
R1 passed OK.
Running test R2 - checking things
R2 passed OK

Note that you need to have all the classes in place for the test to compile:

se/itu/game/cave/Room.java
se/itu/game/cave/Thing.java

The Thing class, you got from the teachers (github).

The Room class, you wrote yourself and you're about to test it.

To run the test for Player:

From the same directory as above, issue the following:

javac se/itu/game/test/TestPlayer.java && java -cp .:sqlite-jdbc-3.16.1.jar -ea se.itu.game.test.TestPlayer
Running test P1 (Picking up and dropping down things)
P1 passed OK
Running test P2 (Dropping things you already have etc)
P3 passed OK
Running test P3 (Moving in illegal direction)
P3 passed OK

Note that you need the following classes to compile the Player test:
se/itu/game/cave/Room.java
se/itu/game/cave/Thing.java
se/itu/game/cave/Player.java

The Player class you wrote yourself and you're now testing if it works.

If you pass all tests, you should be able to start working on the GUI!
